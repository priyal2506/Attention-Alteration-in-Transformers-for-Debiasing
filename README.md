# NLP Attention Alteration in Transformers for Debiasing

## Overview
This project addresses the issue of bias in transformer-based NLP models by modifying the attention mechanism. The goal is to ensure equal weights are given to all demographic groups in the input data, thereby reducing harmful associations while maintaining the semantic understanding of the original encoder.

## Introduction
The issue of bias in natural language processing (NLP) models results in unequal benefits for individuals in positions of privilege. This project proposes a novel approach to mitigate biases in pre-trained transformer-based language models by altering their attention mechanisms.

## Methodology
### Bias Metric Using Attention
The project uses attention values that words in a sentence allocate to other words to calculate bias. Various correlation metrics (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall) are used to gauge the bias present in the attention allocations.

### Debiasing Techniques
Equalizing Attentions: Modifying the attention mechanism to give equal weights to all demographic groups.
Preserving Semantics: Using knowledge distillation to ensure that the semantic information of the original encoder is not lost.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a novel approach to mitigating biases in transformer-based NLP models by altering their attention mechanisms. By equalizing attention weights across demographic groups, we can significantly reduce harmful biases while maintaining the semantic integrity of the original model. The results show that targeted debiasing of the most biased heads and layers is both effective and efficient, reducing computational costs while achieving substantial bias mitigation.

Our method proves that comprehensive debiasing of all layers and heads is not necessary. Instead, focusing on the most biased components allows for a more resource-efficient approach without compromising on performance. The evaluations using attention correlation bias metrics and the GLUE benchmark confirm that our debiased models not only reduce bias but also retain their natural language understanding capabilities.

This work opens new avenues for addressing biases in NLP models and contributes to the broader goal of creating fairer and more equitable AI systems. Future research will extend these techniques to larger models and explore more complex and nuanced biases, further refining the balance between bias mitigation and model performance.
